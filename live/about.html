        <h1 align="center">What is NLL Scorigami?</h1>
        <p>NLL Scorigami is a way of visualizing the different scores that have happened in the National Lacrosse League (NLL) since
            the league's inception in 1987. Each final score is marked in the grid with a square. The colour of the square indicates
            how often that score has happened, and the legend on the right tells you what the colours mean. White squares indicate a
            score that has never happened. Black squares indicate scores that are not possible (i.e. the losing team scores more than
            the winning team, or the score ends up tied).</p>
        <p>A "scorigami" occurs when a game has a final score that has never occurred before in the history of the league. Those
            games are marked with <span class="single">this background</span>.</p>
        <p>Clicking on a square will show you a small popup indicating the number of games with that final score, as well as the
            first and most recent games featuring that score. The entire list of games is shown below the table.</p>
        <p>You can adjust the games shown using the options below the table. You can exclude regular season games or playoff games
            (though you can't exclude both), and you can also exclude minigames.</p>
        <h3>What is a mini-game?</h3>
        <p>In the 2014 and 2015 seasons, playoff series were "best-of-2". If the series ended up tied after two games, a "mini-game"
            was held immediately following game 2. A mini-game was a single ten-minute period that would decide the series. Regardless
            the score of the previous game, the mini-game started out 0-0. Only five mini-games were played, and the format was changed
            to "best-of-3" in 2016.</p>
